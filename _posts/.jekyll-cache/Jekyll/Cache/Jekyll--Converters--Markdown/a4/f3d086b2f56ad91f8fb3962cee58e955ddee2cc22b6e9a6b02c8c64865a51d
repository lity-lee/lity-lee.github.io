<p>Get that Linux feeling - on Windows</p>

<p>What is it?
Cygwin is:</p>

<p>a large collection of GNU and Open Source tools which provide functionality similar to a Linux distributionon Windows.
a DLL (cygwin1.dll) which provides substantial POSIX API functionality.</p>

<p>What isnâ€™t it?
Cygwin is not:</p>

<p>a way to run native Linux apps on Windows. You must rebuild your application from source if you want it to run on Windows.
a way to magically make native Windows apps aware of UNIXÂ® functionality like signals, ptys, etc. Again, you need to build your apps from source if you want to take advantage of Cygwin functionality.</p>
