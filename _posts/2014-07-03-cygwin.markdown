### Cygwin

Get that Linux feeling - on Windows

What is it?
Cygwin is:

a large collection of GNU and Open Source tools which provide functionality similar to a Linux distributionon Windows.
a DLL (cygwin1.dll) which provides substantial POSIX API functionality.

What isn't it?
Cygwin is not:

a way to run native Linux apps on Windows. You must rebuild your application from source if you want it to run on Windows.
a way to magically make native Windows apps aware of UNIXÂ® functionality like signals, ptys, etc. Again, you need to build your apps from source if you want to take advantage of Cygwin functionality.
